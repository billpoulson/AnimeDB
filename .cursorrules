## Commit Checklist (CRITICAL)

Before EVERY commit, complete BOTH of the following:

### 1. Install Script Versioning

Regardless of whether `install.ps1` was directly modified:

1. Copy `install.ps1` to `install_v<N>.ps1`, incrementing N from the previous version.
2. Delete the old `install_v<N-1>.ps1`.
3. Update the README.md to reference the new versioned script filename.

This ensures the versioned script always reflects the latest state of the codebase and bypasses GitHub CDN caching. To find the current version, check existing `install_v*.ps1` files in the repo root.

### 2. Release Notes

Update `CHANGELOG.md` (create it if missing) for every commit that changes user-facing behavior, features, or fixes. Add an entry under the `[Unreleased]` section or the appropriate version heading. Include a brief, user-oriented description of what changed.
