## Install Script Versioning (CRITICAL)

On EVERY commit — regardless of whether `install.ps1` was directly modified — always:

1. Copy `install.ps1` to `install_v<N>.ps1`, incrementing N from the previous version.
2. Delete the old `install_v<N-1>.ps1`.
3. Update the README.md to reference the new versioned script filename.

This ensures the versioned script always reflects the latest state of the codebase and bypasses GitHub CDN caching. To find the current version, check existing `install_v*.ps1` files in the repo root.
